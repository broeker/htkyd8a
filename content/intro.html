            <li>He was a UC Berkely engineering grad</li>
            <li>After working in government as an engineer he dropped out of society and spent the rest of his life in Taos, NM working on volkswagons</li>

        <li>In 1969 he published this repair manual for fixing air-cooled VWs</li>
        <li>I got my own copy as a 16 year old shortly after buying my first VW</li>
        <li>It is safe to say the book changed my life, and it became sort of my bible over the next 10 years</li>
        <li>I started knowing nothing, and in the end there was not a VW i could not get running</li>
        <li>This sessions is in tribute to Muir and this book, and hope that it can be half as useful to you as the book was to me</li>
        <li>It taught me how to diagnosis, maintain, and repair a complex system</li>
        <li>And it turns out that these skills are directly transferrable to keeping a D8 site alive</li>

        * I discovered in the mid 1980s as a teenager
        * It took the complexity out of car repairs
        * It changed my life
        * Tim @ EC

        * Drupal is also "Life nonetheless"
